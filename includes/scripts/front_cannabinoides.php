        <h6 class="cannabinoides_h6text">Xcellence is often found in its raw form and that is certainly true when it comes to plants. We’re talking about the incredible health-promoting properties of an entourage of cannabinoid spectrum whole food supplements. The number of benefits provided by cannabinoids continues to grow as advancements in scientific research progress. Individually, these cannabinoids are powerful forces that counteract many common conditions. CBD is a single molecule that can do amazing things when connected to the rest of the spectrum. Combining full spectrum cannabinoids is the ultimate X-factor for enhancing and
            stabilizing your health.

                <h6 class="cannabinoides_h6text">Xcellerate contains cannabinoid spectrum whole food supplements, such as <b>CBD</b> (cannabinoid). CBD is a single molecule that can do amazing things when connected to the rest of the spectrum.

                    completely water soluble true Full Spectrum Hemp Oil Powder which
                    retains all its cannabinoid, terpenes and phytonutrients in their natural state.

                    Cannabinoids are a diverse set of chemical compounds found in the Cannabis Sativa plant. Their main physiological effect on the body is to act on cannabinoid receptors in cells that repress neurotransmitter release in the brain.  It is fair to say that they are critical in the process of communication between neurons in the brain.</h6>
